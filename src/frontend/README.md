## Project specific notes

- I had to use [this solution](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8768#issuecomment-462091655) to solve this bug:
  ```
  Error: custom keyword definition is invalid: data.errors should be boolean
  ```

## Project setup

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```

```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
